Module 3 - HTTP Connector
======================================================

HTTP Connector is a new feature released in BIG-IP APM 15.1 that allows HTTP requests to be initiated from a Per-Request Policy.  This could be used to send a request to an API to retrieve additional information to make an access control decision, or send information to update an external resource.

Module 4 - Explore AccessGuard
======================================================

F5 Access Guard is a new set of client software tools designed to help administrators validate the security posture of incoming web connections from remote clients. F5 Access Guard allows real-time posture information to be inspected with per-request policy subroutines on BIG-IP Access Policy Manager. F5 Access Guard generates posture information asynchronously and transparently transmits it to chosen APM server endpoints using special HTTP headers

APM has included posture checking capability since its inception, and this new service improves upon this capability by allowing for instantaneous and continuous checks. Deployment of F5 Access Guard is significantly different than previous posture check implementations.

Module 2 - Onboard a Second Application
======================================================

Guided Configuration supports more than a single application per Identity Aware Proxy Deployment.  In this module you will learn how to modify an existing IAP deployment  to onboard new authentication methods, SSO methods, and applications. 

This Module also introduces the **Application Group** (skipped in the previous module) to provide different contextual access controls on parts of a website.

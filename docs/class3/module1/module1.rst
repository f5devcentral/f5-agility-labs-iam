Module 1 - Create an Identity Aware Proxy
=============================================

F5's Identity Aware Proxy(IAP) can be deployed in a variety of ways.  In this lab, you will deploy the IAP using the Guided Configuration (GC). GC allows an administrator to quickly configure and deploy an IAP without any advanced knowledge of APM Visual Policy Editor(VPE).  As a result, an access policy can be deployed in minutes rather than hours.

Timing for Labs
---------------

The time it takes to perform each lab varies and is mostly dependent on
accurately completing steps. This can never be accurately predicted but
we strived to derive an estimate among several people each having a
different level of experience. Below is an estimate of how long it will
take for each lab:

**LAB Timing**

+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| LAB Name (Description)                                  | Time Allocated   |
+=========================================================+==================+
| LAB 1: APM Troubleshooting Lab Object Prep (GUI)        | 20 minutes       |
|   *Do EITHER Lab 1 OR Lab 2 (not both)*                 |                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| LAB 2: APM Troubleshooting Lab Object Prep (TMSH)       | 20 minutes       |
|   *Do EITHER Lab 1 OR Lab 2 (not both)*                 |                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| LAB 3: General Troubleshooting                          | 5 minutes        |
+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| LAB 4: Visual Policy Editor (VPE) and Session Variables | 20 minutes       |
+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| LAB 5: Command Line Tools                               | 25 minutes       |
+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------+

General Notes
-------------

Provisioning Access Policy Manager (APM) is not required for basic
Access Policy uses cases although this has been provisioned for you
ahead of time. This was done to save time as provisioning often requires
services to restart which takes away valuable lecture/lab time.

How to use this Guide
---------------------

For each section, follow the instruction of the class moderator on when
to begin. Carefully read and implement each item step by step.

Archives have been provided for each completed section and can be loaded if
necessary at the beginning of each section for prior labs. You can
install the UCS archive by using the \ **tmsh** **no-license** option. For
the command syntax, refer to the following example:

    ``tmsh load sys ucs [ucs file name] no-license``

Lab Network Setup
-----------------

In the interest of focusing as much time as possible configuring and
performing lab tasks, we have provided some resources and basic setup
ahead of time. These are:

-  Cloud-based lab environment complete with Virtual BIG-IP.

-  The Virtual BIG-IP has been pre-licensed and provisioned with
   Access Policy Manager (APM).

-  Pre-staged configurations to speed up lab time, reducing repetitive
   tasks to focus on key learning elements.

If you wish to replicate these labs in your environment you will need
to perform these steps accordingly.

.. NOTE::
   All work for this lab will be performed within the BIG-IP GUI and
   CLI. No installation or interaction with your local system is
   required.

provided to speed access to targeted resources and assist you in your
tasks. Except where noted, either browser can be used for all lab tasks.

General Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As noted previously, environment staging has been done to speed up lab
time, reducing repetitive tasks to focus on key learning elements. Where
possible steps that have been optimized have been called out with links
and references provided in the *Additional Information* section for
additional clarification. The intention being that the lab guide truly
serves as a resource guide for all your future federation deployments.

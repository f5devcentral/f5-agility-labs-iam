Lab Reproduction
----------------

If you are building your own, here is some important information about
the environment not covered in the lab. This lab environment requires
two Big-IPs. One will act as an OAuth Client and Resource (Client/RS)
Server. The other will act as an OAuth Authorization Server (AS). Both
must be licensed and provisioned for Access Policy Manager (APM).

On the OAuth Client/RS Big-IP you will need backend pools for the two
virtual servers, the lab expects a webapp behind the Social VS that
accepts a header named x-user and reposts it back to the user. The lab
expects an API behind the API VS that can respond with a list of
departments to a request to /department. Also, a DNS Resolver must be
configured on this Big-IP, in our case we donâ€™t have a local DNS server
to respond for the names used, so we are also leveraging an iRule and VS
to answer DNS requests for specific names. You will need a browser for
testing the social module and Postman for testing the API module.
